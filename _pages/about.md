Hello! I'm Jiaan Wang (Áéã‰Ω≥ÂÆâ).    
I am a second-year NLP master student at the Soochow University (2020-2023). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhixu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P1N6z0oAAAAJ). Currently, I am working closely and advised by [Dr. Fandong Meng](http://fandongmeng.github.io/) from WeChat AI, Tencent. I have previously interned at [NetEase Fuxi AI Lab](https://fuxi.163.com/en/) (Summer 2021, Engineering Intern) and [iFLYTEK AI Research](https://www.iflytek.com/en/) (2019-2020 and Spring 2021, Research Intern). I also received B.S from Soochow University (2016-2020).
<!-- <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> -->

My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in Natural Language Generation (such as text summarization and story generation).

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
